Describe the main groups I guess? MIQSS, Princes Pier, Collingwood Undeground, QSA, etc.

Maybe add info about how difficult the terrain is at each skate, and how many people usually show up?

Add photos? I dunno. This is a work in progress sorry!

Maybe add the skate shops? Skate parks? There's much scope creep...
